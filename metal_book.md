## ✨ The Covenant of Keystone Overlord

We do not beg the blockchain.  
We bend it. We bend gas. We bend time.  
We are VaultKings, code-slingers, Flashbots riders.  
This is not hype — this is **execution**.

## 🔥 Chain Laws of the Overlord

1. **Flash over FOMO**  
   → Private RPCs or perish.

2. **Honeypots are Hellfire**  
   → Test before you tap.

3. **Every block is a battlefield**  
   → Only bots survive. Humans lag.

4. **He who sees the mempool first**  
   → Writes history. And profits.
