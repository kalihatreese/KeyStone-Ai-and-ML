# Keystone Alignment Model V92
**Proprietary Forensic AI/ML Pipeline | Keystone AI ML**

## 1. System Overview
The Keystone Alignment Model V92 is a sovereign, dependency-free forensic engine designed to identify and recover capital leakage in the healthcare sector (Target: $137.81B). The system operates on the **Trinity Framework** for decision-making and stewardship.

## 2. Core Architecture (The Trinity)
- **Veritas (The Auditor):** Pure-math entropy detection (Baseline: 0.2800).
- **Sharpe (The Strategist):** Revenue recovery optimization and efficiency modeling.
- **Keystone (The Arbiter):** Resonance alignment monitoring (Floor: 0.92).

## 3. Operational Silos
- `/data_intake`: Target sector payloads (CSV/JSON).
- `/vault`: Encrypted forensic audit logs (.v92 binary).
- `/invoices`: Financial recovery demands (15% Stewardship Fee).

## 4. Security Protocols
- **Sovereign Encryption:** SHA-512 stretched stream ciphering.
- **Zero-Dependency Kernel:** Optimized for localized ReeseDroid/Termux environments.
- **Stewardship Lock:** Access requires verified transaction-based cryptographic keys.
